# My coding Journy
I am a beginner learning to code and started with the course 'Python for everybody' by Dr Chuck offered at freecodecamp.com.
These are the exercises i commit as i progress the course.
If you are also enrolling the same course you can use these exercises and analyse the perspective of another coding beginner "Me". cheers.
