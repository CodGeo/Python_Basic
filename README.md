# My coding Journy
Embarking on the journey of learning Python as a coding beginner is an exciting endeavor. Python, often praised for its simplicity and readability, serves as an ideal starting point for me and anybody stepping into the world of programming. As we delve into the language, we'll discover Python's versatility - from web development and data analysis to automation and artificial intelligence. At first, the syntax might seem like a puzzle, but don't worry! With practice and patience, you'll begin to understand the logic behind it. Through this journey, we'll learn about variables, data types, and how to manipulate them, gradually building the foundation for more complex concepts. Remember, every programmer was once a beginner, so embrace the process, celebrate small victories, and enjoy the exciting path you've chosen!
These are the Exercises I commit as i progress through the course 'Python for everybody' by Dr chuck offered at freecodecamp.com.
